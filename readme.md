# Overview

On this project I tried to create my own 2D game on Unity with no previous knowledge on how build a game. I was very curious on how to apply OOP to a game. I loved the experience of doing it. I think that it reinforce my understanding of concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism. I builded a simple game where you have to avoid being touch by the flames of the enemy. 

Since I had no previous knowledge on game building I was mainly curious on how would that be. I was amazed of how complicated it can get. I liked to see how everything was covered on Unity. They have a tool to work with animations, to try the game, to see every scene and all of this was customizable with code.

# Development Environment

To build the game I used the game engine Unity, I choose it because I thought that it would be much easier to build a game with it and in a way it was, but on the other hand it was much more complicated. Since they have a place for everything there is a lot to learn but once you know how to do things I believe there is a lot that can be accomplished using this software. 

In order to build my game I programmed it using C#. I have some experience with OOP and data structures in this language that is also a reason for me to use Unity. Since it took me too long to draw the graphics of the main player I decided to download the free graphics for the background and the enemy. but I did all the animations myself.
